# Machine-Learnings-Methods-for-Time-Series-Data-Analysis

Here you find notebooks with Change Point Detection methods in Petroleum Data. Mainly I focus to experiment with Fedot.Industrial library.

My point is to create an offline CPD algorithm:

  1. Without a priori knowledge of CPs numbers in data.
  
  2. With auto-selected parameters.
  
  3. Minimum FPs detection.
  
  4. Minimum time delta detection.
  
  5. Maximum CPs detection.
  
  
in progress...
